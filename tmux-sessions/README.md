# Active tmux session notifier

Do you often work with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) on a remote
server, and leave open sessions when you log out? Wouldn't you like to be
greeted with a list of your active sessions when you log back in? Well, just
add the single line from `tmux-sessions.sh` to your `~/.bashrc`, and you will!
